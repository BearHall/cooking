<h1>Cast Iron Pizza: The Easiest Way To Cook A Pizza At Home</h1>

I've tried a dozen different ways to cook a pizza in an oven. Some are easier than others, but the cast iron pan process is the easiest way to make a consistent pizza. We had some folks over on Saturday night and I made 8 straight pizzas and not a stinker in the bunch.
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Some nice color on the bottom of the crust and at least some <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/word-of-mouth-oven-spring-47327">oven spring</a>. This means a hot cooking surface.</li>
 	<li>A top that is brown with melted cheese. This means a top heating unit that keeps up with the bottom.</li>
 	<li>A pizza that looks like a damn circle every time. Mastering a pizza peel takes time. If you're doing multiple pizzas on a night you are going to mess up at least one using a peel.</li>
 	<li>A pizza that tastes good.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Process</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Get a cast iron pan that is large enough to hold your pie. I usually use a Lodge 12" skillet. That gives me plenty of room.</li>
 	<li>Put your oven rack on the second highest level, place your cast iron pan in the oven, and preheat the oven and pan to as hot as your oven goes.</li>
 	<li>Wait at least an hour. Maybe two hours. Do the rest of your prep while this happens.</li>
 	<li>Put all your toppings, sauce, and cheese next to the oven.</li>
 	<li>Turn your oven from bake to broil.</li>
 	<li>Start shaping your dough from a ball to a pizza shape right next to the oven. Here's the trick though. Don't top your pizza yet.</li>
 	<li>Turn on a stovetop burner to high and with two oven mitts* pull the cast iron out of the oven and place it on the burner.</li>
 	<li>Place the shaped dough on the very, very hot cast iron pan. You should be able to simply place it down in a circle. No peels. No mess.</li>
 	<li>Then, and try to do this quickly, top your pizza while the bottom is cooking on the stove top. Sauce, cheese, toppings. A pro tip from my Pizza Hut days, if you pre-mix your toppings and cheese together things move faster.</li>
 	<li>After a minute or two with the pizza on the stove top get those two oven mitts again and put the cast iron in the very hot oven that is on broil.</li>
 	<li>Wait for 5 minutes or so. In this time, the pizza cooks fully and the crust gets brown and the cheese melts completely. Timing does vary so pull it out when it looks ready to you.</li>
 	<li>Use a metal spatula to get the pizza out of the cast iron right away and onto a cutting board to cool.</li>
 	<li>Put the cast iron back in the oven until it's time for the next pizza.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<em>What dough recipe did you use?</em>

I guess, if you want, you could use store-bought dough. I'd cry a single tear if you did, but you could. That way you could at least test the process out. If you want to make your own dough though -- my three favorite recipes are:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Stitts-Bottega-Favorita-Stitt/dp/1579653022/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517503229&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=frank+stitt+cookbooks">The bulletproof recipe is Frank Stitt's from his book Bottega Favorita</a> : You can make this dough an hour before you need it and it works great. I do add probably 1/2 cup more flour than it calls for in the recipe. That being said, it always works for me.</li>
 	<li>Coming in a strong second is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bianco-Pizza-Pasta-Other-Food/dp/0062224379/ref=sr_1_15?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517503581&amp;sr=1-15&amp;keywords=pizza+cookbook">Chris Bianco's recipe from his book</a>: It can be made the day of as well and though I've only made this recipe a couple of times it's been great every time. The whole book is really worth reading too if you want to take a deep dive into pizza.</li>
 	<li>Probably my favorite dough I've ever made is from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0770433715/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Roberta's Cookbook</a>: This is a two-day dough and I haven't perfected the process. So, there are times it comes out better than the above two and there are other times when I find myself quickly making Frank Stitt's dough to replace the failure.</li>
</ul>
<em>Do I see pre-shredded cheese in one of those photos?</em>

It hurts me as much as it hurts you. I hate pre-shredded cheese, but if you're doing a bunch of pizzas it makes life much, much easier.

<em>Do I need to oil my cast iron pan? Will the pizza stick?</em>

I think if you have a well seasoned pan and you cook the pizza fully then it shouldn't stick. However, if you want to do a layer of grapeseed oil on the pan that works fine. It will fry the bottom a little quicker so be warned.
