"Be warned, I might have pushed this roux a little too far." With that, I left a bowl filled with black veggie gumbo on Melissa's bedside table and went back downstairs. She was fighting a sickness. I was watching football. An hour or so later she came down the stairs saying she loved the gumbo and, in fact, it reminded her of the jjajangmyeon <a id="jjajangmyeon" title="A note in praise of geat Maangchi" href="#1">[1]</a> her mom used to make. Next time, she suggests, let's serve this over jjajangmyeon noodles.

And so we did.

Well, the next time I got scared and didn't push the roux far enough. It was dark brown but nowhere close to the black that is needed to replicate the fermented black soy bean paste, black of jjajangmyeon. So we didn't eat it over noodles. We ate it over rice and we called it gumbo. It was fine. The leftovers remain uneaten.

Round three. I pushed the roux again and I documented the whole thing. So here we go. For those who like the idea of mixing a classic from South Louisiana with a classic from South Korea.
<h2>Gumbomyeon</h2>
It really is about how much you want to push the roux. The deeper, longer, and darker you're willing to go with the roux the better the end product is. The goal is to have shiny, black sauce with a thick consistency. When you mix the sauce with the noodles the sauce should stick and stay stuck to the noodles. Beyond that, you'll want to have some chopped up veggies and meat that simmered in the gumbo for a couple of hours. The exact items don't matter that much. It's kind of like chili in that way. You need to have your base right, but beyond that just go wild. Be warned though, the longer things simmer, and they should simmer for a while, the more things are going to break down. Some of the items you throw in there should be of hearty stock. Things that can stand a couple of hours in a hot tub and still come out intact on the other end.
<h3>The Ingredients</h3>
This was a veggie meal. Most gumbos have sausage and/or chicken and most jjajangmyeons have pork. You can add that if you'd like. It will taste good. They aren't needed though.

<ul>
 	<li>An onion or two depending on size, diced</li>
 	<li>A bell pepper or two, diced</li>
 	<li>A couple celery stalks, diced</li>
 	<li>Five or six cloves or garlic, minced</li>
 	<li>1/2 cup of flour</li>
 	<li>1/2 Cup of grapeseed Oil</li>
 	<li>Equal amounts of potatoes and turnips, maybe a cup or two of each, diced</li>
 	<li><a title="The great secret ingredient in almost all dishes." href="https://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-Bouillon-Chicken-Base/dp/B000VDSS3C">Better Than Bullion</a> dissolved into 2 cups of water</li>
 	<li>2 dark beers (1 for drinking and 1 for gumboing)</li>
 	<li>1 jalapeno, diced</li>
 	<li>1 cucumber, cut into matchsticks</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.maangchi.com/ingredient/jja-jjang-myun-noodles">Jjajangmyeon noodles </a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roux">The Roux</h3>
Have I explained how important the roux is for this? Here's the thing: a dark roux takes a good amount of time. <a title="A note in praise of Isaac Toups' gumbo video" href="#1">[2]</a> Maybe 45 minutes. Maybe an hour. It depends on how high you're willing to keep the heat.

Get a Dutch oven pot and put it on the heat. Let it warm up for a couple of minutes. Then add the 1/2 cup of grapeseed oil and let that get shimmering. Then add the 1/2 cup of flour and start whisking that bad boy right away.

This is where you need the first beer, possibly a black cup of coffee, because you're going to be sitting by the stove and stirring the roux until it gets to looking pretty close to the black coffee or stout beer in your hand. It's going to take some time. This pot took me 45 minutes. I had the heat on 7 and just let it go. I listened to a podcast and made sure things didn't burn on the bottom. It gets kind of zen at some point. Every once in a while I'd call Melissa over and ask her if it was dark enough. She'd tell me to keep going and so I would. Finally, I got to a point where the roux was dark and shiny and ready for the next step.
<h3>Veg Out</h3>
Things move pretty quickly for a couple minutes and then they don't. So pay attention.
<ul>
 	<li>Add the celery, onion, and bell peppers to the roux and mix things around for a couple minutes. Let things simmer and soften. Add a pinch or two of salt to the mix and keep on stirring.</li>
 	<li>Add the crushed garlic and stir that around. Let that soften up for a minute or so. Don't wait too long though. It would be a shame to spend all that time on a fancy damn roux and then burn the garlic.</li>
 	<li>Pour in 8 to 12 ounces of beer into pot and stir things around.</li>
 	<li>Then the water / BTB mixture.</li>
 	<li>Stir until the roux is dissolved in the liquid and everyone is friends.</li>
 	<li>Add a little more salt, drop in some bay leaves, and twist away on the black pepper for 10 to 20 turns.</li>
 	<li>Add the potatoes and turnips. Oh, don't forget jalapenos.</li>
 	<li>Stir around some more and let things simmer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Simmer Down Now</h3>
Here's the part where things don't move fast. Let this pot of veggie jjajangmyeon simmer for several hours. You don't need to keep your eye on it the whole time. Every 30 minutes to an hour walk by and stir things up. You don't want it to reduce too much. You really don't want to let it burn on the bottom. You do want it to simmer some flavor and also get thicker in consistency. You don't want soup. It should be thick and shiny and generally taste good.

Feel free to test for taste. If it needs salt then add salt. If it needs heat then dash in some cayenne. Really add what you'd like to make it taste good to you.
<h3>The Final Nood Down</h3>
After a couple of hours of simmering and your gumbo hits the right thickness, shine, and taste, then it's time to boil and plate the noodles. The trick to jjajangmyeon noodles is you need to rinse them in cold water after boiling them. If you don't do that they'll be too gummy and generally gross. So boil the noodles, rinse the noodles, and add them to a bowl. Top each bowl with a generous serving of the gumbo. To garnish I had some leftover cornbread so I broke that up into crumbs and toasted the crumbs in the oven for a couple of minutes. I topped the sauce with those toasted crumbs and cucumber matchsticks. I also took about half the cucumbers and gave them a quick pickle.
<h2>The Review</h2>
I thought it turned out pretty great. There's a ton flavor that gets formed from just a deep roux and some basic vegetables. The jjajangmyeon noodles are chewier than the Italian style noodles I'm used to and it gives a strange, but interesting texture to the whole dish.

Melissa liked it, but she had a tougher time getting her head around the dish. It looked a lot like jjajamyeon, but it didn't taste exactly like jjajamyeon. I can see that being strange. I didn't have that childhood memory to overcome. She also did not like the garnishes. She was completely out on the cornbread breadcrumbs and would have preferred only fresh cucumber instead of half fresh and half pickled.

Her main suggestion, besides killing the cornbread, was to drizzle a little sesame oil over the dish as a way to tie the two ideas together. We'll try that next time.

I ate the leftovers the next day for lunch and added a cubed up pork chop to the mix. It was really pretty damn great.

<h1 id="1">Various Notes &amp; Sundries</h1>
<ol>
 	<li>Jjajangmyeon is a Korean noodle dish that has a sauce made of fermented black soy bean paste as the main ingredient. Melissa tells stories of the dish including not just pork, but all kinds of other squids and such. It's also apparently super messy and any good Korean has plenty of jjajangmyeon stained shirts from mixing up a bowl.
